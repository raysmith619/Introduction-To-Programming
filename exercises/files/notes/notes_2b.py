"""
Add case insensitivity

Write a "Notes" program. The program will display lines
from a text file, containing a given text string.
Test:
file name = "people.notes"
text = "Watertown"
 Implementation Iterations:
Setup test file(s): "test.notes",  "people.notes"
    1.	Read specific file e.g. "test.notes", printing out all lines
    2.	Print only lines containing "student"
            How to match lines ? Google "python search for substring" ?
            Support case insensitive match (Student, STUDENT)
    3.	Prompt for, then accept file name, pattern
    4.	[Extra Credit]  Support multiple text patterns

"""
file_name = "test.notes"
pattern = "student"
with open(file_name) as finp:
    pattern_lc = pattern.lower()    # Force pattern to lower case
    for line in finp:
        line = line.rstrip()        # All trailing white space
        line_lc = line.lower()
        pat_index = line_lc.find(pattern_lc)
        if (pat_index > 0):
            print(line)
