                    Computer Programming Things
                    ==================================            
                    What is a (computer) program?
                        Instructions (to the computer)
                        as what to do

                        A Plan

                    What are some attributes?
                        Abstract, Doesn't wear out
                        Writen once used many times

                        Mistakes  not always apparent
                        Mistakes seen again and again

                    Techniques:
                        Iteration - small improvements
                        Reuse copy, saveas, modification
                        Rules / Style
                        Small learning examples
                        Interactive exercises

                    Common Things:
                    Source code - commonly in a file
                                readable text
file_name.py

                    Comments - informal / descriptive
# comment line
"""
Multiple line "doc"comment
can go over many lines
"""

                    Arithmetic / Computation
+ - * / % **
+= -= *=
()
                    Variables
a b name short_name
NOT 1a, short name, long-name, with,comma

                    Constants
1,2,3
4.5, 6.78
True, False
                    (character) Strings
"Twas the night before Christmas"
' and all through the house'
story = "Beginning"
story += " middle"
story += " end."


                    Decisions - choice
if a > b:
    max = a

if num % 2 == 0:
    is_even = True
else:
    is_even = False


                    Loops - repeated operation
n = 1
while n < 5:
    n += 2
    print("n:", n)
    
for n in range(1,5,2):
    print("n:", n)
    
break
continue
                    Grouping
Python uses indentaton
Don't mix spaces and tabs!
A group of statements must be indented to the same
number of spaces.
Indentatoin rule is relaxed inside (), [], or {}.

                    Functions
                        (Some written by others)
print("Our Story:", story)
guess = input("Please Enter a guess:")
n_guess = int(guess)

                        (Some you can create)
def my_story(st)
    return "Our Story " + st

print("Using my_story ", my_story(story))

                        Multiple and Key word parameters
def print(*args, end="\n", sep=" ")
    ...
print("a", "b", end="", sep=":")

                    Multiple program files / External support
import random
from random import randint
target = randint(1,20)  # Create a random target between 1 and 20

                    Help is out there
Google "python random int between two numbers"


                      Life is full of lists...
my_friends = [] # Lonely
my_friends.append("Joe")
my friends.append("Tom")
for friend in my_friends:
    print(friend)

                    Dictionary - "A list, but by name/key

positions = {"president" : "George Washington",
           "vice president" : "Jhon Adams",
           "treasurer" : "Michael Hillegas"}
for position in positions:
    print(position, ":", positions[position])
