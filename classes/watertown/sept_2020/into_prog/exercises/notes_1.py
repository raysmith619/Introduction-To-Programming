"""
Write a "Notes" program. The program will display lines
from a text file, containing a given text string.
Test:
file name = "people.notes"
text = "Watertown"
 Implementation Iterations:
Setup test file(s): "test.notes",  "people.notes"
    1.	Read specific file e.g. "test.notes", printing out all lines
    2.	Print only lines containing "student"
            How to match lines ? Google "python search for substring" ?
            Support case insensitive match (Student, STUDENT)
    3.	Prompt for, then accept file name, pattern
    4.	[Extra Credit]  Support multiple text patterns
