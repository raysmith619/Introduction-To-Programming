From Me to Elizabeth Yusem:  (Privately) 07:09 PM
just type into the blank file.
From Elizabeth Yusem to Everyone:  07:09 PM
i’m on mac too and don’t see how to do new or run a new filewhere do you do the new file in the command line?
From Wendy Etkind to Everyone:  07:12 PM
on a mac, click on the file, then the “run” option menu comes up
