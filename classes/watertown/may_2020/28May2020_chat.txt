FYI, I have used Zoom about a dozen times, and just about every time, my speaker audio cut out after about 30 minutes. If that happens again, I will need to exit the room, and log back in. But I believe you would have to let me in again! Hope that makes sense!

my son just suggested to try a larger font size
From Megha Durukkar to Me:  (Privately) 06:34 PM
may be Display driver issue; all menus are blurr, font or font size wont help 
From BORE JOKIC to Me:  (Privately) 06:35 PM
it looks like ascii code sent via fax five times over
From Megha Durukkar to Me:  (Privately) 06:37 PM
may be Display driver issue on host system; all menus are blur, font or font size wont help; 

From Soham Samanta to Everyone:  06:38 PM

From Scilla Bennett to Me:  (Privately) 06:51 PM
What he’s showing isn’t in the zip file, he’s just showing examples that you can try in a blank file in idle

From Lakpa Sherpa to Everyone:  07:29 PM
I want to know about elif 
please
From Ruth DeSarno to Everyone:  07:34 PM
seems like elif is a combination of else and if?
From Jeffrey Berry to Everyone:  07:39 PM
I think elif is setting a new special condition.
From FATMA VATANSEVER to Everyone:  07:39 PM
What does the ! mark stands for
From Ruth DeSarno to Everyone:  07:40 PM
right but that condition is equal to else + if
From Carl Karandjeff to Everyone:  07:40 PM
! as in != means not equal
From Jeffrey Berry to Everyone:  07:41 PM
Pretty much.
From FATMA VATANSEVER to Everyone:  07:41 PM
