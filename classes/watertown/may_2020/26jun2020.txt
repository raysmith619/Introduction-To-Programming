how to use try?if we type string instead of number.
From Lakpa S Sherpa to Everyone:  06:29 PM
error handlingI think, we should use try and except in that case to handle error.

I'm getting an error message that says "Unindent does not match any outer indentation level." It's right after ans == "n" of ans == "N":
From Jeffrey Berry to Everyone:  06:33 PM
Do you have that as "of" or as "or"?
From Sarah Rauhut to Everyone:  06:34 PM
if ans == "n" or ans == "N":can someone ask for me? My microphone doesn't work.
From Jeffrey Berry to Everyone:  06:35 PM
Check where the if statement is, compared to the "while" statement.Python depends on indentation, i.e. white space, which makes it hard to fix, sometimes.
